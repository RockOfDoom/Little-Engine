// Alexa is proud of the audio design and music that she did. This was the first time she worked with audio, and she learned a lot.
// Ardent implemented a way to draw a custom font onto the screen, in NumberRenderer.js. 
//      This was new to them and it worked out pretty well.
// Alex is proud of the jump that he made and the series of logical statements that make it feel good to use, 
//      (found in Engine.js between the jump() method and the update() method)
// Star animated the player character in three distinct states. The outcome was very effective, and the character is very cute!
// We made a really interesting and unique looking setting that is still cohesive. 
// The fuel system that we made adds a layer of resource management to the endless runner genre. 
//      In the game, you are always running out of fuel, which is a unique feeling to our game.
